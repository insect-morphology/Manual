# Adding new terms #

Open your `ontology-edit.owl` file.

Make sure that the term that you are about to add **DOES NOT** exist in the ontology yet. This can be done by searching the term: go to `Edit` and then `Find`, which will open the `Search` window. Start typing the term. The program will start showing the terms that contain the compination of letters that you are typing. 

**Note:** We tried our best to named combined terms from dorsal to ventral (e.g., noto-pleural conjunctiva) or proximal to distal (e.g., pleuro-coxal muscle), but just in case, make sure to search for both options (i.e., pleuro-notal, coxo-pleural).
