The manager of the order-specific ontology should request a "placeholder repository" to be hosted at [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology) in GitHub by emailing [István Mikó](istvan.miko@gmail.com) or [Jennifer Girón](entiminae@gmail.com). 

The name used for this repository will be used later as the `abbreviation_for_your_ontology` and also the ID of the ontology to be registered at the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/about-OBO-Foundry.html). At this point, the repository will only contain a README.md file.
