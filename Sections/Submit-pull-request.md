## Submit pull request

These steps need only to be followed by the **order-specific ontology manager**, as this person should have the initial ontology files created using the [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). At this point, the **order-specific ontology manager** should have a forked repository on their profile with all the initial ontology files ready to be submitted to the base repository at [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology), which  will be used by collaborators. Instructions for order-specific ontology editors can be found here: ---.

At this point, all you have to do is submit a "pull request" to [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology) to get these new files incorporated into the original "placeholder repository" that you requested in [step 1](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/Sections/Setting-up-main-repository.md) of this [manual](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual).

Whether you used [git commands](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/Sections/Using-git-commands.md) or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/Sections/Using-GitHub-Desktop.md) to upload the ontology files from your compueter into a GitHub repository, your forked repository (i.e. `https://github.com/insect-morphology/abbreviation_for_your_ontology`) should have all the files and this message at the top:

![GitHub Branch Ahead](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubBranchEven.png)

Just click on Pull request near the top of the repository.

![GitHub How to Pull Request](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubHowPullReq.png)

Which will take you to a new page that should show no incompatibilities between your fork an the original repository at [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology):

![GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubPullReq.png)

Click on the "Create pull request" green button on the right, which will give you the option to include additional information. Try to get into the habit of adding a few details about the changes made for this pull request, as this can help in the future to track back issues that might arise.

![GitHub Pull Request message](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubPullReqMsg.png)

Then press the "Create pull request" green button on the bottom right. This will submit your fles to be reviewed by the [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology) admins, who will check that your files are complete, and accept your pull request.

You might want to assign reviewers to your pull request, as this will notify them personally. To do this, just click on "Reviewers" on the right, which will show you the list of available admins. For now the most appropriate people would be István Mikó (teleaslamellatus) or Jennifer Girón (JCGiron), who are most familiar with this whole ODK-AISM process.
