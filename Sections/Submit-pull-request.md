## Submit a pull request to [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology)

Once you have files or edits to be included on the main ontology repository, all you have to do is submit a "pull request" to the appropriate repository within [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology).

Whether you used [git commands](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/Sections/Using-git-commands.md) or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/Sections/Using-GitHub-Desktop.md) to upload or update the ontology files from your computer into a GitHub repository, your forked repository (i.e. `https://github.com/insect-morphology/abbreviation_for_your_ontology`) should have all the files and a message like this at the top:

![GitHub Branch Ahead](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubBranchEven.png)

Just click on `Pull request` near the top of the repository.

![GitHub How to Pull Request](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubHowPullReq.png)

Which will take you to a new page that should show no incompatibilities between your fork an the original repository at [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology):

![GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubPullReq.png)

**Note:** If there are incompatibilities, you can still submit your request to be evaluated bu the ontology **manager**, who will be able to check and resolve those incompatibilities.

Click on the **"Create pull request"** green button on the right, which will give you the option to include additional information. Add a few details about the changes made for this pull request, as this can help in the future to track back issues that might arise.

![GitHub Pull Request message](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual/blob/main/img/GitHubPullReqMsg.png)

Then press the "Create pull request" green button on the bottom right. This will submit your fles to be reviewed by the [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology) admins, including the ontology **manager**, who will check that your files are complete, or your changes are appropriate, and accept your pull request.

You might want to assign reviewers to your pull request, as this will notify them personally. To do this, just click on &**"Reviewers"** on the right, which will show you the list of available admins. For edits to the AISM, or to submit an AISM-based ontology, the most appropriate people would be István Mikó (teleaslamellatus) or Jennifer Girón (JCGiron).
