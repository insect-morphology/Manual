## Editing the AISM and AISM-based ontologies using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)] ##

Here we outline the steps to be able to add, edit and annotate an existing [AISM-based](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism) ontology. Some instructions here are adopted from the [Gene Ontology protocols](https://go-protege-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

In order to perform the steps in this section you will need to:
1. Have [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) installed
2. Have a clone of your forked repository in your computer.


Open Protégé. Click on `File`, `Open…`, and find the `abbreviation_for_your_ontology-edit.owl` file (e.g., `GitHub/abbreviation_for_your_ontology/src/ontology/abbreviation_for_your_ontology-edit.owl`

In my computer, this is
`GitHub/aism/src/ontology/aism-edit.owl`

Explore the ontology and its hierarchy by clicking the entities tab in the top left area:
